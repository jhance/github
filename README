This project is incomplete and what is complete is alpha-quality at best. Some
of it is untested code, but it is currently under development as a one man
project. It is written in some of my spare time, so doesn't expect it to be
complete for awhile. I am trying to make sure that I get at least some work
done on this at least once a day.

Although it has a file github.cabal, this will be renamed in the future since
there exists another github package on hackage... Alternative name suggestions
are welcome.

Information on Hacking:
    - If you only need one small thing from a package and other names are
      liable to pollute the namespace, please use a restriction
    - If names will collide, please use qualified imports
    - Document anything that is exported, including the module. This project
      should have 100% Haddock Coverage.
    - All functions, etc, should have a "Since" tag on them. I forget this alot,
      too.
    - Any function related to a HTTPS request should have an "Equivalent to"
      tag above the "Since" tag.
    - Pull requests are always welcome

Information on Versioning:
    - It currently depends on conduit-0.4. When more of the package is complete
      it will probably be updated to conduit-0.5. Most of the changes will
      probably be simple renames and probably occur in
      Web.GitHub.Internal.Request.
